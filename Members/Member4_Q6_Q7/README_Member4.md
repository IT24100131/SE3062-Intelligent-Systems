## 3. Technical Implementation & Mathematical Justifications

### Q6 — Corners Heuristic (`cornersHeuristic`)
- **Core Concept:** Problem relaxation by dropping maze walls.
- **Algorithm:**
  - Extracts the set of unvisited corners from the search state: `remaining = [c for c, v in zip(corners, visited) if not v]`.
  - Computes the minimum Manhattan distance tour from Pac-Man's current location through all remaining corners via recursive search across permutations (at most $4! = 24$ permutations, evaluated in $< 0.1$ ms).
- **Admissibility Proof:**
  - Removing walls creates a relaxed problem. The optimal solution to a relaxed problem can never exceed the optimal solution to the original constrained problem:
    $$h(n) = \text{cost}_{\text{relaxed}}^*(n) \le \text{cost}_{\text{original}}^*(n)$$
- **Consistency Proof:**
  - In a single unit transition from $n$ to $n'$ ($c(n, a, n') = 1$), Pac-Man moves by at most 1 unit in Manhattan distance. Thus, the relaxed tour cost decreases by at most 1:
    $$h(n) - h(n') \le 1 \implies h(n) \le 1 + h(n')$$
- **Performance:** Expands only **741 nodes** on `mediumCorners` (Pass threshold is $\le 1200$ nodes for full 8 marks).

### Q7 — Food Heuristic (`foodHeuristic`)
- **Core Concept:** True maze distance to the farthest remaining food dot.
- **Algorithm:**
  - Extracts active food dot coordinates: `food = foodGrid.asList()`. If empty, returns 0.
  - Returns $\max_{f \in food} \text{mazeDistance}(\text{pacmanPosition}, f)$.
  - **Memoization / Caching:** Uses `problem.heuristicInfo['distCache']` to memoize pairwise maze distances across A* node evaluations, avoiding repeated BFS searches.
- **Admissibility Proof:**
  - Pac-Man must consume every remaining food pellet. To eat all pellets, Pac-Man must at least reach the pellet furthest away:
    $$h(n) = \max_{f \in \text{food}} \text{dist}_{\text{maze}}(n, f) \le \text{total path cost to consume all food}$$
- **Consistency Proof:**
  - Shortest path maze distances satisfy the triangle inequality:
    $$\text{dist}_{\text{maze}}(n, f) \le \text{dist}_{\text{maze}}(n, n') + \text{dist}_{\text{maze}}(n', f) = 1 + \text{dist}_{\text{maze}}(n', f)$$
  - Taking the maximum over all $f \in \text{food}$ preserves monotonicity: $h(n) \le 1 + h(n')$.
- **Performance:** Expands only **4137 nodes** on `trickySearch` (Threshold for full marks is $\le 7000 / 9000$ nodes).

## 4. Verification & Autograder Results
- **Q6 Autograder Score:** `8/8` marks (Expanded 741 nodes $\le 1200$, path length 106).
- **Q7 Autograder Score:** `8/8` marks (Expanded 4137 nodes $\le 7000/9000$, optimal cost 60).
- Total autograder score for Q1–Q7: **40/40 Marks (100%)**.

Run from `Group_Project/search/`:
```bash
# Run autograder for Q6 and Q7
python autograder.py -q q6
python autograder.py -q q7

# Full suite verification
python autograder.py --no-graphics

# Visual test of Corners A*
python pacman.py -l mediumCorners -p AStarCornersAgent -z 0.5

# Visual test of Food Search A*
python pacman.py -l trickySearch -p AStarFoodSearchAgent
```

## 6. Viva Cheat-Sheet (Rapid-Fire Defense Questions)

1. **Why is the sum of Manhattan distances to food pellets inadmissible?**
   - *Answer:* Summing distances assumes each food dot requires an independent trip starting from Pacman, drastically overestimating the cost. Multiple dots along a single corridor can be collected in one path.

2. **Why use true maze distance instead of Manhattan distance for Q7?**
   - *Answer:* Maze distance accounts for walls and dead ends. Manhattan distance is too loose of a lower bound in complex mazes like `trickySearch`, causing A* to expand over 16,000 nodes (failing the mark threshold). Maze distance guides A* tightly, cutting expansions down to 4,137 nodes.

3. **Why is memoization in `heuristicInfo` critical for Q7?**
   - *Answer:* Evaluating `mazeDistance` runs a BFS. Without memoization, evaluating thousands of states in A* would trigger tens of thousands of BFS searches, causing an autograder timeout. Caching pairwise distances ensures each BFS is run at most once per unique pair.

4. **Define Admissibility and Consistency. Why is consistency necessary for graph search?**
   - *Answer:* Admissibility means $0 \le h(n) \le h^*(n)$ (never overestimates). Consistency (monotonicity) means $h(n) \le c(n, a, n') + h(n')$. In graph search, consistency guarantees that when a node is popped from the priority queue, the shortest path to it has already been discovered, eliminating the need to re-open nodes in the closed set.
